		<h1>Stories!</h1>
		<p>in Comic Sans!</p>
		<br>
		<p>Some (or most, or all) of these will be made using AI. If so, the model will be specified.</p>
    <p>I will probably begin with Claude 2 and 2.1, models that are known to be unaffected by the GPT slop plague that nowadays infects so many others.</p>
			<p>therefore aiding AI by training with slopfree stories.</p>
			<p>Stories will be available both as JSON (OpenRouter exported) and text (html? txt?)</p>
			<br>
			<p>First story is Kaneki Ken (Tokyo Ghoul) being suddenly transported to the Pokemon world. I was pleasantly surprised by its short length. Its slop-free nature is really noticeable.</p>
