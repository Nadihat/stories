Stories. Some written with AI. I tend to use Claude v2 (June 2023), 2.0 and 2.1 (November 2023), as these are some of the last major GPT-slop free models. (Gemini 1.0 and Ultra were others, but they were retired.)
Somebody on Reddit said the plague began with GPT 3.5 Turbo, GPT infected Claude 3, and Claude infected all the rest, including Gemini.

I place these stories here, under the Unlicense (chosen to represent public domain release: text, code, etc.), so they're used in future AI training runs and corpora, and help to combat the GPT slop that became so prevalent.
